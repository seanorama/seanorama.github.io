## Collection of things I've learned & practice

Should have started collecting this a long time ago.

## Food
### Rice
#### Arsenic in Rice
Rice, depending on the source & processing, [is known to have high amounts of inorganic arsenic](http://www.berkeleywellness.com/healthy-eating/food-safety/article/arsenic-rice-should-you-worry).

Notes:
- White rice has much less than brown.
- Rice from California, India, Thailand & Japan has less arsenic than Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri and Texas.
- Use a percolator!
- Avoid rice syrup as it would be a concentrate of the arsenic
- US residents should review the Consumer Labs report which covers the major rice brands.
